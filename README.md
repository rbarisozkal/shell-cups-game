This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
I have used TailwindCSS and Framer Motion for animation and styling of my application.
### This is Baris Ozkal
## Getting Started

To install and run the development server:
I have used Node version : 18.x
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
# or
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

***
I have also added couple of comments (I wasn't sure if I should add comments or not) to explain the code a little bit.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `numberOfCups` in `app/page.tsx`.
